## Description
To work with APIs we will use the Postman app! Postman allows you to quickly create a request with the required HTTP method and parameters, set the body, headers, submit the request and easily inspect the results.

Postman can help if you are developing APIs as well! I have created this course for testing engineers and well for software developers. Postman can help you during the development of your API as well as after the API is completed, by running tests that make sure your API is still working as intended.

Postman has over 10 million users worldwide and continues to grow. This course will introduce you to Postman and is suited for beginners. You will learn how to build API requests with Postman, how to inspect responses debug any issues.

Postman has grown to be a complex tool that has many capabilities

So let’s look at what you are going to learn during the course:

Start with simple requests

Advance towards more complex scenarios

Upload files
